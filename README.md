# document-classification

**Problem Description:**

We process documents related to mortgages, aka everything that happens to originate a mortgage that you don't see as a borrower. Often times the only access to a document we have is a scan of a fax of a print out of the document. Our system is able to read and comprehend that document, turning a PDF into structured business content that our customers can act on.

This dataset represents the output of the OCR stage of our data pipeline. Since these documents are sensitive financial documents we have not provided you with the raw text that was extracted. Instead we have had to obscure the data. Each word in the source is mapped to one unique value in the output. If the word appears in multiple documents then that value will appear multiple times. The word order for the dataset comes directly from our OCR layer, so it should be _roughly_ in order.

Here is a sample line:

```
CANCELLATION NOTICE,641356219cbc f95d0bea231b ... [lots more words] ... 52102c70348d b32153b8b30c
```

The first field is the document label. Everything after the comma is a space delimited set of word values.

The dataset is included as part of this repo in ./doc_classification/model

**Data Description**
After counting in hash_table, we found there are 14 document labels at all.
